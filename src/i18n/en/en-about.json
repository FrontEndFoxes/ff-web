    "aboutPurpose": "Front-End Foxes Inc., a 501(c)(3) public charity (EIN 83-3866803), is an initiative founded by Jen Looper in 2018 that creates and hosts workshops to teach front-end technologies to women in a cool and fun way. Our activities include free self-driven code labs completed in a workshop format in groups with mentoring by volunteers, either online or in-person. The goal of the program is to familiarize women with front-end technologies in a supportive and inclusive environment. We also manage a scholarship fund to help women attend technical conferences. We have hosted successful longer events such as Vue Vixens Days in Argentina, Colombia, and the US. With chapters worldwide, you can probably find a group near you!",

    "activitiesDescription": "What can you expect from a Front-End Foxes event? Well, as a student, perhaps new to the field of front-end development, you are given the opportunity to learn about various frameworks for building both web and mobile apps. Over the course of a breakfast, a lunch 'n' learn, or a full day workshop, which we call â€˜skulksâ€™, you'll work with a mentor in small groups in a hands-on, self-driven learning environment. You'll complete the task of building a web app and a mobile app that will teach you about the framework and programming in JavaScript. You'll also get a chance to meet and work with like-minded students and interface with leaders in the industry and make valuable professional connections.",

    "mentorsNote": "If you're joining one of our skulks as a mentor, firstly, thank you! Because of you, we can offer free workshops to new developers in a supportive environment. Your job is to stay with your mentees throughout the day, helping them over any difficulties and giving them a view of the life of a seasoned professional developer. You're the best! Just to be clear, anyone can be a mentor for Front-End Foxes! We are grateful for your participation.",

This groupâ€™s focus is on the education and promotion of women developers, and those who identify as such. The founder of this organization, Jen Looper, is a Wellesley College Alumna (class of '92) and takes the college's admission criteria as a blueprint. To paraphrase their statement of admissibility:",
